# Seminar 0729

- **Main thread**: Use EpiTOF technique to explore the epigenomic marks of single immune cells sampled from **OLDER AND YOUNG PEOPLE** in order to study the epigenetic variation between elders and youngest.

- **Epi-genomic modification**

  on histone

- **样品重复性越好，方差越小**

- **Three Things**

  - How **EpiTOF** works

    

  - Chromatin Modification Profiles Predict Immune **Cell Identity**: How? What's **cell identity**?

  - How Divergence of Chromatin Modification Profiles between Genetically Related Twins Widens with Age
  
    How to exclude other factors
