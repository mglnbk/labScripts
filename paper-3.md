## 1. Background

Chromosome structural variations occur frequently in cancer genomes and play a crucial role in tumorgenesis. “enhancer hijacking” (Wang 等。2021, p. 661) is refering to the phenomena that SVs juxtapose the enhancers next to key cancer genes leading to their abberant elevation of expression.

- GATA2 enhancer is near to the EVI1 in AML
- MYB gene is near to a superenhancer.

CESAM and PANGEA are regression models which predict the hijacking events in genome. They are trained on bulk of data, not applicable in scarce number samples. 

The author put forward a new method based on solely Hi-C data of 50 cell lines spanning across 17 cancer types.
