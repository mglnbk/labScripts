# Differential cofactor dependencies define distinct types of human enhancers

## main goal

use cofactor dependencies to identify the distinct type of enhancers, providing a framework 
to illustrate enhancer function and regulatory specifity.

## BackGround

Transcriptional process needs **TFs and COFs** binding. Prominent COF include EP300, BRD4 and CDK9
, which mediates throurough **initiation, pause-release and elongation step**

## Process

1. Use AID-system to deplete each COF mentioned above
2. Use STARR-seq to assess the enhancer-activity following the loss of each COF
3. Each COF is tested based on the data obtaained above
4. The final result shows that some of transcriptional processes are running well without COFs

## Main Difficulty
1. AID-system
2. STARR-seq reveals what kinds of information
3. How to define the enhancer regions
